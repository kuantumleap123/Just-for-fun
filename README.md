Just stand-alone files that do stuff

* Calculator: receive arithmetic operation string, parse and evaluate
* Reflection: inspired by Lumosity's Pinball Recall game, predicts exit location of pinball based on location of entrance and reflector position
* The Amazing Maze: Start from the middle of a grid. Randomly choose and move 1 step at a time in any direction (up, down, left, right), as long as that cell has not been stepped on before. Walk ends when no steps can be taken (trapped) or when you have walked out the grid (escaped).
